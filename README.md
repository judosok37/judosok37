<introduction>
My aspirations tend to inflate, causing me to deflate rapdily. Finally, I have decided to utilize my free time to tackle said aspirations.
I understand a lot of coding basics, but need to start utilizing it in my everyday; currently running through Angela Yu's "100 Days of Python"
On the upside, I'm also getting into HomeLab Networking setups as well, and intend to get into virutalization.
<br><br>
Language Goals: HTML/JS/CSS, Python, Bash, Powershell, MySQL

Most of the projects (TBD) at the moment are guided projects done in the 100 Days course, but my intentions are to add my own spin to them.
My code is messy and in most cases inefficient, but at somepoint I will eventually re-add them as I get more experience writing cleaner programs/scripts.
